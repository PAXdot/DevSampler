/**
 * @lucasmarkes/hairline — Elevator, scoped out of the twenty-seven figure
 * package to stand alone. The wrapper below is `react.tsx`'s `make()` and
 * `index.ts`'s `elevator()` factory, combined for this one figure: a
 * component renders one empty `<div>` and mounts the figure on it in a
 * layout effect, so on the server the box is there and the drawing is not.
 * It mounts once: a changed option reaches the running figure as `update`,
 * and `onRead` is called through a ref, so an inline function never remounts.
 *
 * Four floors beside an open shaft. The pointer's height picks a floor, and
 * the car travels there through the ones between. `intensity` makes the car
 * travel faster.
